		<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>This Easy Chocolate Fudge Recipe is made with just a few ingredients and it comes out perfectly every single time! You don’t need a candy thermometer or any fancy tools either.</p>
			<p><em>Homemade Fudge is one of my favorite Christmas desserts! This easy chocolate fudge version is hands down one of my favorite things to make!</em> </p>
			<p>There are thousands of different homemade fudge recipes and it can be very overwhelming when it comes to choosing which one to make. I’ve made quite a few fudge recipes over the years spanning from super easy 3-ingredient fudge recipes to semi-complicated recipes and this easy chocolate fudge recipe is my favorite!</p>
			<p>There are only a handful of ingredients in this recipe and it’s pretty much impossible to mess up. In fact, it’s such an easy recipe that I’d totally rename it to something like ‘Perfect Chocolate Fudge’ or ‘Best Chocolate Fudge.’</p>
